## Application Description
The proposed application, Beauty from the Seoul, serves as a comprehensive guide for skincare enthusiasts visiting or living in Seoul, South Korea. As a city renowned for its skincare products, Seoul boasts a diverse range of brands and types of skincare items. This application aims to help users easily find information about various skincare products, as it can be overwhelming to choose from the vast amount of selection available.

By providing detailed product listings, user reviews, store locations, and promotion events, our application will empower users to make informed purchasing decisions——or to get your money's worth, as they say——while exploring Seoul's vibrant beauty scene.

## Modules to be Implemented
### 1. Landing Page  
Contains a display of the current featured products and a carousell of ads from specific brands. If you click on said ads, it would direct you to the catalogue of the brand. To view the product catalogue, you can choose a specific brand or product type on the navigation bar. A "view all" option is also available.

### 2. Product Catalogue  
Contains cards of the skincare products, each card contains the product's name, brand, price, description, type, and reviews. You are able to filter the catalogue by brand or product type. Other than viewing, a user can add a product to their "favorites" list and review a product by leaving a rating and/or comment.

### 3. User Favorites  
Each user has their own "favorites" list. They can "love" a product to add it to the list and also delete a product from their list. 

### 4. Skincare Store Locator
An interactive map that shows users where they can buy skincare products in Seoul, with integration to Google Maps.

### 5. Promotion Events
Contains cards of promotion events occuring/about to occur in Seoul. Each card contains info about the store location, promotion type, and period of promotion. A user can RSVP to an event, the card will then list all the users that has RSPV'd.
